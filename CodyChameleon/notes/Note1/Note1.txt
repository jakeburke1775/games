This is meant only to communicate my love for coding and my desire to make games. 
Please admire my organization and disregard my spelling. Before you criticize my use of 'var,' know that this is GML, not JS.
They are very similar, but GML is for making games.

This is right from a tutorial by Payton Burnham.

First, I made the code more comprehensive to myself by adding lots of comments. 
I also made the code collapsible in a way that should make sense to your average Joe.

I added lerping to the speed, which adds a challenge and a more polished look for the player. 
Because of this, I will need to update the sprites next, which comes with a bit of collision math.
