# Games

Here you will find the incredible range of games I have in development.
Know that this is GML, not JS.

This is meant only to communicate my love for coding and my desire to make games.
Please admire my organization and disregard my spelling.

Currently, it is only made of a template that I followed along with on a youtube channel with a few of my own additions (see IDE notes for specifics). I'm not interested in sharing a lot about this just yet. There are more important projects relating to my job search that will be worth more of my time/documentation. This will be a project I work on at least once a week to start off. My goal is to make this prototype in a few weeks and just make it fun. I will work on this to unwind.

## Differences between GML and JS

### Purpose and Usage

GML: Primarily used in GameMaker Studio for game development. It's tailored for creating games with 2D graphics, animations, and interactions.

JS: A general-purpose programming language used for web development, server-side scripting, and creating interactive web applications.

### Syntax and Structure

GML: Has a simpler syntax and structure, making it easier for beginners to learn and use for game development.

JS: More complex syntax and structure, with features like closures, prototypes, and higher-order functions, which are essential for advanced web development.

### Environment and Execution

GML: Runs within the GameMaker Studio environment, which provides tools for designing game assets, testing, and debugging.

JS: Runs in web browsers and on servers (Node.js). It interacts with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages.

### Libraries and Frameworks

GML: Uses built-in functions and libraries provided by GameMaker Studio for game-specific tasks like sprite handling, collision detection, and physics.

JS: Has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, jQuery) for various web development tasks.

### Performance

GML: Optimized for performance in game development, with efficient handling of graphics and animations.

JS: Optimized for performance in web applications, with features like asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await) to handle tasks like network requests.

### Community and Resources

GML: Community is focused on game development, with forums, tutorials, and resources specific to GameMaker Studio.

JS: Large and diverse community with extensive resources, tutorials, and documentation available for web development.
