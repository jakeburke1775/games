# games

Here you will find the incredible range of games I have in development.

Currently, it is only made of a template that I followed along with on a youtube channel with a few of my own additions. I'm not interested in sharing a lot about this just yet. There are more important projects relating to my job search that will be worth more of my time/documentation. This will be a project I work on at least once a week to start off. My goal is to make this prototype in a few weeks and just make it fun. I will work on this to unwind.
